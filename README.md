# divine-feminine-mirror-scraper

Ever listen to [_The Divine Feminine by Mac Miller?_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Divine_Feminine) I have. It's sweet. The the mirror in the album cover is sweet too.

> "I'm a very big believer in the universe existing within everybody. And so that was a part of the album, was the universe existing in this female that I'm talking to. And my brother actually took that photograph, and it's just a photo. Like the clouds, everything was just a photo that he took. I saw it and was like, 'wow that's it.' He was almost like 'no,' because he does all of my cover designs, and he [said] 'it's too easy,' and I [said] 'no, that's like exactly what I'm talking about.' It summed everything up, and I loved that it was a real photo."

Some company [setup a website and sells products based on the album cover](https://macmirrors.com), and although it looks exactly like the album cover, it doesn't beat the lookalike mirror that [Target sold a few years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacMiller/comments/b7qk1y/pssstthe_divine_feminine_mirror_is_in_stock_at/). I think the Target mirror is something that I would want to put on my wall, more so than the carbon copy mirror.

This project will ideally be a bot that parses through mirrors sold online quickly until it finds the Target mirror. Hopefully using ebay, facebook marketplace, etc APIs if possible.
